# The Art of Simplicity

Complexity is easy. Anyone can add features, layers, and abstractions. The real challenge is knowing what to leave out.

## The Subtraction Game

Every line of code is a liability. Every feature is a maintenance burden. Every option is a decision your users have to make. The art of good software is aggressive subtraction.

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

## Starting With Why

Before adding any feature, ask:

- **Why** does this need to exist?
- **Who** is this actually for?
- **What** problem does this solve that can't be solved more simply?

## The Power of Constraints

Constraints force creativity. When you can't add another button, you find a better interaction pattern. When you can't add another configuration option, you pick better defaults.

Some of my favorite constraints:

- Single-page applications that do one thing well
- APIs with fewer than 10 endpoints
- UIs that work without JavaScript

## Examples in the Wild

The best tools often feel magical because of what they *don't* do:

- **Unix tools** that do one thing exceptionally well
- **Stripe's API** that makes complex payments feel simple
- **Linear** that reimagined project management by removing cruft

## The Maintenance Dividend

Simple systems are easier to:

- Debug when things go wrong
- Extend when requirements change
- Explain to new team members
- Reason about under pressure

## Fighting Feature Creep

Some strategies that help:

1. **Write requirements in reverse** — start with the simplest possible solution
2. **Default to "no"** — make adding features harder than removing them
3. **User story hygiene** — every feature needs a specific user and use case
4. **Regular simplification sprints** — dedicate time to removing complexity
